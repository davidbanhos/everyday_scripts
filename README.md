# everyday_scripts
Simple compilation of scripts for work, study, or correlated tasks.

## Goals
I keep repeting myself with tasks and writing scripts for these. But, I end up losing these informations, as life brinds us to different paths (like a phylisopher...).
This repository will keep some scripts and notes for further reference.
It's a small collection and it's just starting, neverthenless please feel free on copping/clonning/fixing any information here, kindly drop a pull-request.

## Utilization
- Add Windows like scripts onto the _os/windows_ folder.
- Linux scripts onto _os/linux_.
- And so on, you're smart and you can understand this logic...
- _docs_ folder, for general notes.

## Scripts' description

### Windows

- [runjava.bat](os/windows/runbash.bat) : Run bash commands (WSL) from Command/Powershell

## Notes

- [Oracle on docker](https://gist.github.com/davidbanhos/edf141333e755e9acb7785ad82bab6a0)
